Current quantum devices are prone to errors in measurement. This lead to the generation of error states in final circuit measurement. But can the amount of entanglement in a quantum system influence the population of error states? If so then by how much? This project aims to find out if any such influence can be used to determine how much entanglement is present in a given system.
